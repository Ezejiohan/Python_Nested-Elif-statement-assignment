Rollercoaster Ride Eligibility Program

This is a simple Python program that checks whether a user is tall enough to ride a rollercoaster and calculates the ticket price based on their age.

📌 How It Works

The program welcomes the user.

It asks for the user’s height (in cm).

If the height is 120 cm or more, the user is allowed to ride.

The program then asks for the user’s age and displays the ticket price:

Age ≤ 12 → $5

Age ≤ 18 → $7

Age > 18 → $12

If the height is less than 120 cm, the user is not allowed to ride.
